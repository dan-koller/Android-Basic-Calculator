# Android Basic Calculator

This is a basic calculator app for Android. I developed it to improve my Android development skills.
In particular, I wanted to learn more about the combination of UI and logic in Android.

## Features

The app is pretty self-explanatory. It supports the basic operations addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division. Division by zero is handled elegantly.

## Installation

The app is not yet available on the Google Play Store. You need to build the app yourself. You can
do this by cloning the repository and building the app with Android Studio.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dan-koller/Android-Basic-Calculator
```

_Note that the app targets Android 10 (API level 29)._

## Technologies

The app is written in Kotlin and uses the Android SDK.
